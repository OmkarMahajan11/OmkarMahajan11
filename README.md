# Hello There

....general kenobi! 

## About me first

I hail from Maharashtra. I love thinking about life, existence and our place in greater scheme of things. Am a big believer in dreams. I love Computer Science and I consider 'Dune' to be the greatest science fiction ever.

What am I like in person? Well, I like to think I am Captain Picard but with a full head of hair!

I used to work as a Data Analyst at an interesting startup, where we helped our clients grow their revenue, conversions and traffic with analytics and experiments. That's where I discovered my love of programming.

I currently work as a Software Engineer part of [Daton](https://sarasanalytics.com/daton) team, where we develop a data pipeline with 100+ connectors and multi-warehouse support.
